# Mitsuriou's Follower Bodies Overhaul: Preset Creator
MFBOPC is a relatively simple GUI application that should allow anyone to change a body mesh of a follower or an NPC to another body mesh (currently supporting the most popular body types and some of their custom variants, as well as some custom feet mods).
In addition, the user will generate files that the BodySlide application is able to read, to easily custom the follower's or NPC's body shape.

MFBOPC has been designed to work with **Skyrim: Special Edition only**. The application might be able to work for other games with future updates...

At this time, the application is only capable of changing the body, hands and feet meshes and cannot convert any cloth, outfit or armor: it is a difficult and very time consuming task even for a Human being, I'm not sure of being able to make the application that is that powerful.

# Requirements to run the software
- [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable 2015 - 2022 (x64)](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

# Requirements to compile the source code and create install wizard file
[Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/) along with:
- Desktop C++ development kit.
- [Qt VS Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TheQtCompany.QtVisualStudioTools2022) extension.

[Qt version 6.3.0](https://www.qt.io/download) with MSVC 2019 package.

[Inno Setup](https://jrsoftware.org/isdl.php) version 6 or newer.

Once all the requirements are correctly installed, change the Qt Version associated to the Visual Studio Solution and run a compile of the full VS Solution.

# Development roadmap
Since most of the features are now included in the application, you can consult the very little number of tickets from the [GitHub Project](https://github.com/Mitsuriou/MFBO-Preset-Creator/projects/1)'s page of MFBOPC.
